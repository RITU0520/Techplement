Developed an Online Courses website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a modern, user-friendly platform for accessing valuable educational resources.
The website offers essential features like user sign-up, login functionalities, ensuring a secure and personalized experience for each user. 
With a well-organized layout, the site is designed to cater to learners of all levels, helping them find the right courses that match their goals and aspirations.
The website boasts an intuitive user interface (UI) crafted with meticulous attention to detail. Using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, I created a visually appealing design that enhances user engagement.
JavaScript was implemented to power dynamic elements such as form validations, interactive navigation menus, and seamless transitions. Each page of the site is responsive, ensuring optimal usability across various 
devices,from desktops to smartphones.
